# IoT Temp Watch
IoT Temp Watch is a mini full-stack project that retrieves temperature from a public sensor and displays it directly in the browser. It’s a great project to understand how data flows from the backend to the frontend.
## Main Features:
•	Retrieves temperature (or humidity) from a public API.
•	Stores data in a SQLite database via a Python/Flask backend.
•	Displays data in real-time in the browser using React.
•	Allows viewing the latest value and the full temperature history.
•	Simple and clean code, ideal for learning full-stack development basics.
### Technologies Used:
•	Backend: Python + Flask for handling data and API.
•	Frontend: React to dynamically display temperature data.
•	Database: SQLite to store local measurement history.
#### Available API Endpoints:
•	/data/latest : fetches the latest measured temperature.
•	/data/history : shows the complete temperature history.

 => I enjoyed working on this project because it allowed me to understand the full data flow: from fetching via an API, storing it, to displaying it in real-time in the browser.
